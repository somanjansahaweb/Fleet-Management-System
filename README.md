🏍️ Project Overview: Bike Rental System in Python

The Bike Rental System is a Python-based project that simulates the working of a real-world bike rental service. It allows users to rent and return bikes, and helps the admin manage the system efficiently. The project demonstrates key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance, combined with loops, functions, and exception handling to create a smooth and interactive experience.

⚙️ Key Features

Rent Bikes: Users can rent bikes on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.

Return Bikes: The system calculates the total bill based on the rental period and type.

User & Admin Interaction: Built with clear role-based logic to manage operations effectively.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid inputs using exception handling.

Continuous Operation: Uses a while loop to keep the program running until the user exits.

Reusable Design: Functions and return statements are used for modular and maintainable code.

Inheritance: Demonstrates OOP inheritance by creating different classes for the rental shop and customer.

🧠 Core Python Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – for creating structured, reusable, and organized code.

Inheritance – to extend the functionality of classes and promote code reusability.

Functions and Return Values – for clean, modular, and efficient code logic.

While and For Loops – to control user interaction and perform repeated operations.

If-Elif-Else Blocks – for decision-making based on user input.

Exception Handling – to prevent crashes from invalid or unexpected input.

Main Function – serves as the entry point of the program, ensuring clean execution flow.

🧩 Program Flow

1. The program starts with a main() function.


2. A BikeRental class manages the inventory and rental process.


3. A Customer class (inherited) handles user-related operations like requesting and returning bikes.


4. The user interacts with the program via a menu-driven interface.


5. While loops keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.


6. Exception handling ensures smooth operation even when invalid input is provided.
